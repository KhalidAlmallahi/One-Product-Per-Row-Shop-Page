# WooCommerce: One Product Per Row @ Shop Page

By default, WooCommerce displays 4 products per row in the shop page. This is nice for almost any ecommerce website, however in certain cases you might want to change this setting in order to show full-width products (a.k.a. one product per row).

In this post weâ€™ll look at the alternatives you have in regard to changing this setting, and also some CSS adjustments to make the 1-product-per-row shop page look better. Enjoy!

If you also want to change the dimensions of your product images, go to WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Product Images and make sure the width of your Catalog images is at least 1000px.
